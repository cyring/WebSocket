# WebSocket
## Purpose
This is an example of a WebSocket server written in C using the [libwebsockets library](https://github.com/warmcat/libwebsockets).
Every second, the server pushes the Linux system information toward the Javascript clients.
## Build
The program is delivered with a [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org) project file.
